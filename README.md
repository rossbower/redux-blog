#HW 4 - Ross Bower

I created a blog website with individual routes for new, home, and post views. The posts are editable. Everything works :)

Extra Credit:
  - Looks snazzy (x10)
  - Markdown included
  - Reset blog feature (removes all posts, does not yet refresh)
  - Added functionality of refreshing page when desired (i.e. edit, delete)
