#HW 4 - Ross Bower

I created a blog which displays a list of all posts (with tags) and allows you to create, view or delete posts. There are individual routes for the home page, creating a new post, and viewing single posts. The posts are editable. Everything works :)

Extra Credit:
  - Looks snazzy (x10)
  - Markdown included
  - Reset blog feature (removes all posts, does not yet refresh)
  - Added functionality of refreshing page when desired (i.e. edit, delete)
